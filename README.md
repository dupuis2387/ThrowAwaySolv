# ThrowAwaySolv

A throw away coding test I was asked to put together, with a one day turnaround time.

It uses:

- EntityFramework targetting SQLite
- .Net Core 3
- Swagger/Swashbuckle
- Sample showing of using AutoMapper
- Repository pattern


### Requirement:

As part of your technical exercise, you are responsible for creating RESTful APIs for the
movie web app that other developers can then use to build a single page application. You are not
required to build the front-end, your focus will be on the backend of the application.




### Acceptance Criteria:

- Movie list: 
Every item in the list will display a thumbnail movie name and showtimes. When the user
clicks on an item, it will display the details in a new view.

- Search: 
It will search the movie details shown in the movie list. Results are displayed as filtered out
list of movies.

- Movie details: 
Full-size picture with a title and all the details of the movie.



### Instructions :

Open solution file in Visual Studio 2019 and hit F5


## Todo:

Write unit tests. That's the only thing I didn't have time for, yet.
